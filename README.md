# BlurBackground
Blur Background Animation with SwiftUI

![blur-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5228713/114130624-99014d00-991e-11eb-8e96-0db95434e462.gif)

SwiftUI is not providing default animation effect for blur background while we show some views on top of other views. I added a code to bulr the reamining background view. I used **BackgroundImageView** and **BlankView** to fullfill the expected behaviour.


# How to use?

Please check the **ContentView** file where I showed an example to blur the background and other views.
